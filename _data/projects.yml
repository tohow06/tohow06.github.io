- title: "NASA Lunar Autonomy Challenge"
  description: "Developing an autonomous agent to control a virtual lunar robot in a simulated Moon environment using a custom CARLA simulator. The robot must efficiently navigate, localize, and map lunar terrain and rocks while managing limited battery power. Passed the qualification round and now advancing to the final round."
