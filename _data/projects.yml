- title: "NASA Lunar Autonomy Challenge"
  description: "Developing an autonomous agent to control a virtual lunar robot in a simulated Moon environment using a custom CARLA simulator. The robot must efficiently navigate, localize, and map lunar terrain and rocks while managing limited battery power. Passed the qualification round and now advancing to the final round."

- title: "3x3 Cube Solver with Visual Recognition and Hardware Integration" 
  description: "Developed a comprehensive Rubik's Cube solver application combining computer vision, AI algorithms, and physical automation. The system can detect cube states via webcam, generate optimal solutions, and visualize the process. Additionally, it integrates with a robot to solve the cube physically. The solver uses Kociemba's two-phase algorithm and CFOP method to optimize solutions."
