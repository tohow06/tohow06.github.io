# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am completing my Master's in Robotics and Autonomous Systems at Arizona State University. 
  At [Dreamslab (ASU)](https://dreams-lab.replit.app/), advised by [Jnaneshwar Das](https://search.asu.edu/profile/3327973), I currently lead the final phase of the NASA Lunar Autonomy Challenge, focusing on autonomous navigation and robotic perception. 
  My research includes engineering an autonomous UAV integrating LiDAR-Inertial-Visual SLAM with ROS2 and PX4 for 3D reconstruction tasks. 
  Previously, I conducted research at the [Robots and Medical Mechatronics Lab](http://rmml.bime.ntu.edu.tw/nturmmle.html) at NTU, advised by [Ping-Lang Yen](http://rmml.bime.ntu.edu.tw/profe.html).
